* GVRO

Gradient-vector matrices are formed by collecting gradient vectors in a local seismic patch as columns. For single-dip signals, the gradient vectors will group along same lines. So, gradient-vector matrices should be approximately rank-one matrices. For multi-dip signals, the local seismic data are decomposed into single-dip components, with each componentsâ€™ gradient-vector matrices regularized to be rank-one matrices. The proposed gradient-vector rank-one regularization (GVRO) model is solved in the frame work of block coordinate descending algorithm, and can be used for random noise attenuation and coherent signals separation according to the dip differences.

* SR1

We presented a generalization of the low-rank approximation, which allows to individually shift the column of rank-1 matrices (SR1). This model was designed to represent objects that move through the data. This holds in applications such as seismic or ultrasonic image processing as well as video processing.

* TSDL

We proposed a  tree structure dictionary learning (TSDL) method.  Our approach is based on two components: a sparse data representation in a learned dictionary and a similarity measure for image patches that is evaluated using the Laplacian matrix of a graph.
