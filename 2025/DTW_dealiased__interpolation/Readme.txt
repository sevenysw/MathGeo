# An open-source Matlab code  for dealiased seismic data interpolation.
>> Xu Y, Yu S, Dong L, Ma J. Dealiased seismic data interpolation by dynamic matching[J]. Geophysics, 2024, 89(5): V361-V376.
>>We proposed a new interpolation framework for the regularly missing seismic data based on the LARDTW algorithm. The proposed approach has superior interpolation and antialiasing abilities. In addition, the proposed approach is computationally efficient and can successfully interpolate data with irregular gaps in the presence of noise.
>>The demo illustrates the interpolation process of this method.
